        <td>In Socrates’ Defense, Socrates is responding to claims made by judges of Athens (namely Meletus, Anytus, and Lycon) that he has “corrupted the youth”. First, Socrates tells that the Oracle had informed his friend Chaerephon that no man was wiser than Socrates. Socrates, however, did not think he was wise at all. Thus, he visited artisans, poets, and politicians because he thought that certainly one of them would be wiser than he. He, however, discovered that all these individuals thought they knew much information, but did not in reality. Upon informing them of this misconception, he received hate from them.   He begins by arguing that Meletus himself does not care for the youth, and instead likes to accuse the innocent for a matter he knows nothing of. He asks him who he thinks are the appointed improvers of the youth. To this, Meletus responds that judges of the state are responsible for improving the youth. In response, Socrates then points out that if the judges were to improve the youth, they would do their neighbors good, and evil do them evil”  noticed Socrates’s corruption and should have advised him before charging him. Basically, Socrates points out (and Meletus confirms) that “good do their neighbors good, and evil do them evil” Thus, if these judges were good, they would advise Socrates before punishing him with a one day trial in which he can not even adequately defend himself. Socrates defends that “if my offence is unintentional...you ought to have taken me privately…” Meletus confirms that Socrates corrupts the youth because he teaches the youth to not acknowledge the gods accepted by the state. He clarifies his charges with Maletus, and realizes that his accusers believe Socrates is an atheist. Socrates then accuses Maletus of trying Socrates’s wits, and states that Maletus understands this logical conundrum. Thus, Maletus is intentionally playing with the mind of Socrates.  Socrates urges the committee to ponder; “can a man believe in spiritual and divine agencies, and not in spirits or demigods?”</td>
        <td>He argues that the offenses made against him are a contradiction because he teaches the youth about gods other than what the state accepts. Thus, how can he be an atheist?</td>
        <td>He argues that ultimately, all he is concerned with is the improvement of his soul, and this is what he urges to do. “You might as well affirm the existence of mules, and deny that of horses and asses.”</td>
        <td>Socrates utilizes a confirmation bias approach to the main argument of Maletus. Ultimately, Socrates is arguing that this accusers are more at fault than he is because their claims against him are highly invalid.</td>
