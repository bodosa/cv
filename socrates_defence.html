        <h3><em>Quotes that are interesting</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What you will not hear from me at all, I swear to you by Zeus, men of Athens, is language like theirs, full of fine words and phrases and arranged in due order. What you will hear will be in the words that come to me at the time, and as they come to me, since I am confident that hat I say is just.</li>
            <li>I am actually wiser than this person; likely enough neither of us knos anything of importance, but he <em>thinks</em> he knows something, when he does not, whereas just as I do not know anything, so I do not think I do, either</li>
            <li>The outcome was that I asked myself, in defence of the oracle, whether I would prefer to be as I am, and not be either in the least bit wise with their wisdom or ignorant with their ignorance, or to have both their wisdom and theirs ignorance together</li>
            <li>And when anyone asks them what they have against him, and what he teaches that has this effect, they have nothing to say ans simply do not know</li>
            <li>Because if there is one person and only one who corrupts our young men, while everyone else benefits them, it would be a great piece of good fortune in their case</li>
            <li>You refused that option and preffered to bring me to court, when the law says prosecution is for those needing punishment, not lecturing</li>
        </ul>
